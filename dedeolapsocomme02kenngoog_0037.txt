'x111 PARS PRIOR

ue neo tapso. posuit, relicta poesi dramatica‚ metm
modosque spencira, sorte haud om-
nino feliciter, usurpabat.

Two powers o'er mortal thing dominion hold

Ruting the wordl with a dividet lot,

Immortal, all pervading, mautsold,

Twln Genii, equat Gods‚

O'er the wide wild abus two meteors ebone,

Α blood-red Comet‚ and the Morniug Stat,

Mingling their beans in combut - us he stood.

All thoughts within his mind waged mutual war,

ln dreadt'ul sympathy -when to the flood

That fair Stur fell, he turned and shed his brother’s blood·
Thus evil triumphed‚ and the spirit os evil,

One Power os many shapes, which none may know:
One Shape of many namen: the Fiend did revel

In victory, reigning o’er a wordl os woe.

For the new rute ot man went to aud fro,

Famished und hometess, loethed and loething, wild,
Hating good, for his immortal soe,

He changed som starry shape beauteous and mild,
To a dire Suake, with man and beast unrecouciled.
And the great spirit os Good did creep among

The nations of mankid‚ and every tougue

Cursed, and blasphemed him as he pased3 sor noue
Knew good from evil, though their namet were hung
In mockery o’er the sane where many a grean,
herting, and Lord, and God‚ the conqueriug Fiend did own.

«Mortalibus rebus duae praesident
potentiae, terrasque divisa sorte re·
