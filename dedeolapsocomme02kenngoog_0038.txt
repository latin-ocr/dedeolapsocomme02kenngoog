PARTE PRIMA 15

εἰ aggira; e propostosz' di parlare del aveo camo.
Dio de’ Crz'ste'anz', lasciata la poesia
drammatz'ca, fa suoi, non del tullefele'·
cernente, z' metri e ι’ modi dello Spemer.

Pwo powers o’er morial thing domim'on hold
Ruling tlte word! wille a dividet lot,
Immortal, all pervading, mamfold,
Twin Genii, equae Gaas, “
O'er the wide wilei ahyss two meteors shone,
A blood-red Comet. and tlte Moming δίαν,
Mingling their heams in comba! - as ke stood,
All thoughts within Ιιιζς mind waged mutual war,
. In dreadsul sympatey- when to tlte stood
ssat fair Starsell, lte turned and slted his brother's blood.
ms evil triumphati, and tlte spirit os evil,
One Pom os many sltem, ethich none may know
One Shape of many names ,· tlte Fiend did revel
In victory, reigning o'er a uordl os ecoe,
For tlte new race os man went to and sro,
Famzkleed and komelesk, loathed and loathing, πίλα,
Hating good, sor leis immortal soe,
He changed som starry shape beauteous and milti,
To a dire Snake, m'tle man and beas! unreconciled.
And tlte great spirit os Good did creep among
Tlee nations of mankid, and every tangue
Cursed, and blasphemae him as he passed ,· sor none
Knew good from evil, though their names were hung
In mockery o'er the fane where many a greum
As K ing, and Lord, and God, the conquering Fiend did ouen.

‹Alle mortali cose due potenze
